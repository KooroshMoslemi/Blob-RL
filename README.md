I tried to train a reinforcement learning model on a simple custom game in python using tensorflow2.
The game is the same used in [this](https://pythonprogramming.net/q-learning-reinforcement-learning-python-tutorial/) tutorial series and the traininig procedure is inspired by [this](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/tree/master/lab3) notebook from MIT.
